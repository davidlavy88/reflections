When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Secure, I can download when I want and use all Git features.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because there isn't always changes I want to commit. I need that option.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork: clone a repository in Github (online), clone clones a repository between PC's or PC and Github, and branches adds a branch in your local repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    It will know that once I update the status of the remote, what changes I made and what changes have other made, then will tell me what has been modified.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    It would be pretty difficult trying to keep track of all the changes. Using git and Github is much easier.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
